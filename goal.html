<p>
To raise awareness around the needs and value of Heatherwood Park so the residents of Heather Gardens, Meadowood and our other surrounding communities have the opportunity to invest in the park’s future. Through outreach we hope to build stronger bonds with our neighbors, and therefore, a stronger community centralized around such an integral part of our neighborhood.
<br><br>
Did you know?:
<li>Heatherwood Park was saved by our community.
We owe a lot to the 1st generation of families who believed in our community and knew what the establishment of the park meant for future generations.  Please review the History section for a full understanding of past and current efforts.</li>
<li>Short timeline for raising funds.
We have a tight timeline for raising funds and community participation and need your help.  The City of Larkspur is a great resource and partner in this project. Unfortunately, they have not been able to allocate the necessary funds to maintain the park so we are going door-to-door, holding events and reaching out to you. We need to show we are serious about Heatherwood Park and investing in our community. There are a variety of ways to get involved by contributing to the Heatherwood Park fund or offering your time and skills to improvement of the park.</li>
<li>Heatherwood Park adds 5 – 10% to the value of your home if you live in Heather Gardens or Meadowood.</li>
This is no small amount of money when you consider the average sales price of a home in these neighborhoods.  We polled local realtors who specialize in Larkspur and know the area well.  Heatherwood Park is a major selling point for buyers looking at your home because it is an extension of your yard and the stories of group gatherings, annual events and kids playing embody a community most people want to grow old in.</li>
<br><br>
Where do we go from here?<br><br>
Please read through Events and Contribution areas of this site.  A committee has been established to organize community resources and our contact information can be found on the Contribute page.

"Schedule downtime. The trick to self-mastery actually lies in the opposite of control--effortlessness, relaxation, and well-being... Control is fatiguing, while brain imaging research shows that relaxation is not only restorative but actually leads [to] enhanced memory and facilitated intellectual understanding. In other words, while you're participating in relaxing activities, your brain is still processing. It's important that the brain has had time to relax, restore, and reflect."
