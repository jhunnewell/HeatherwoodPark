<p>
	Timeline:
		<li>1950s – park was created from a donation of a local rotary club.</li>
			<li>Late 1960s – Heatherwood Park falls into disrepair and playground equipment moved to another park.</li>
				<li>1970s – Not a great time for municipal budgets. Park almost sold off to developers for $1 but saved by a joint community committee made up of people from Heather Gardens and Meadowood.</li>
					<li>Late 1970s – park is saved through community involvement and contributions.</li>
						<li>1980s – 2000s – park is maintained by the City of Larkspur with support from our community.</li>
							<li>2007 – 2014 – Heatherwood Park requires certain updates but funds are tight and being redistributed across many of the city’s parks.</li>
								<li>2015+ - Heather Gardens and Meadowood invest in the safety and beautification of Heatherwood Park making it a great place to visit for all generations.</li>

More detailed history:
<br>(sentences marked with *...* are from Richard "Dick" Kohler, retired Larkspur firefighter and 52 year resident)
<br><br>
Initially built during the 1950s when a piece of land was sold to Larkspur for $1 by either the Kiwanis’s Club or the Lion’s Club.  Unfortunately no one seems to remember but we are grateful nonetheless.
<br><br>By 1967, the park was overgrown and all the play equipment was removed to Dolliver Park (“Dark Park”).
<br><br>
In the early 1970’s Meadowood was constructed and the new neighbors on the hill discovered it was once a park by talking with the old timers* then living in Heather Gardens.  The community got together and created a joint community committee to explore restoring the park to go before the city council to get their blessings. They were happy to have the park restored and said they would budget $8000 for the project.
<br><br>
The committee met for about a year putting together a plan for the park and how to pay for it. They heard a rumor that the city was going to sell it to a developer for $1. After approaching City Hall the committee was told to put up some money or yes it would be sold. The $8000 was no longer available.  This was the late 1970s with hyperinflation and the recent passing of Prop 13 which was putting unusual constraints on the city’s budget. The city council recommended getting an annual commitment from each household or it will be sold. The committee walked and convinced each household to pledge $15 a year to the project. In doing so, they took down their names, ages and how much they could give. Most of the people were over 65 and living on fixed income. The committee  made and sold “T” shirts to raise money for the park.
<br><br>
Looking in the paper one day, Phil Terry saw an ad for a HUD meeting. He applied for community funding and was rewarded $144,000 for Larkspur. Harland Barry used half of the money to get the park built and the other half of the money to build the pump house. Due to high inflation the committee ran out of money to replenish the park where the grass ends. Jerry Reinke and a few neighbors built the basketball court a few years later.  Great investment as this basketball court covered a consistently muddy area of the park and is heavily used today.
<br><br>
There have been several presentations to the Larkspur Park and Rec Commission requesting the city finish the park, fix the drainage problems, etc.  but this group is stretched thin. They have promised to put our park to the top of the list but as we all know budgets have been slashed and priorities reshuffled.  We currently have a list of items that must be completed over the next few years so the park is ADA compliant. We also have a growing list recommendations that we as a community would love to see implemented to enhance the beautification and usability of our park.
<br><br>
Thank you to the original committee which consisted of Clay Weans, Clyde Ostler, Sue Janin, Jerry Porter, Bill Howard, Jerry and Sue Reinke all of Meadowood. Phil Terry, Stewart Barbee, Dick Koehler, Mr. Feeney and others from the Heather Gardens neighborhood.

"In the summer of 1995 or '96 the old wooden (read rotten) play structures were torn down and over a long but fun weekend neighbors assembled and installed the current play equipment under the supervision of the City. Irene Kolher fed burgers and lemonade to the crew."

*Phil Terry is an “old timer” and we, the younger generation, respect his use of the phrase as the park history has been provided by him.
